### What is Scientific Computing?
Computational science, also known as scientific computing or scientific computation, is a rapidly growing field that uses advanced computing capabilities to understand and solve complex problems.

### Why Scientific Computing?
Over the past several years, numerical simulations of phenomena in technology and the natural sciences have been shown to be an essential tool for accelerating development cycles in industry and businesses. Whereas researchers once had to meticulously study the properties of a product on the basis of prototypes, they are now simulated and optimized on computers. Demands on the capabilities of numerical simulation continue to grow with the need for models that are more and more precise, the incorporation of new problem areas such as data analysis (e.g. big data), and parameter-dependent problems and models with uncertain data. This was triggered by the relatively young and forward-looking research area scientific computing.

### Why Scientific Computing is Important for Biologists?
This is a time of increasing interdisciplinary research. Computer science is learning more from biology every day, enabling a plethora of new software techniques to flourish. And biology is now beginning to see the returns, with new models, analyses and explanations being provided by computers. The merging of computer science and biology is a hard thing to achieve. It takes a lot of effort. You have to overcome much resistance on both sides. But itâ€™s worth it. In this paper, which accompanies the keynote presentation for Evolution Artificielle 2001, Peter J. Bentley discusses a new breed of scientist called the Digital Biologist, and why they are so important. Examples of research that benefit both fields will be provided, including swarming systems, computational development, artificial immune systems and models of ecologies. Only by working together will biology learn how nature works, and computer science develop techniques that have some of the awesome power of nature.


### What is Bioinformatics?
Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data, in particular when the data sets are large and complex.

### What is Computational Biology?
Computational biology involves the development and application of data-analytical and theoretical methods, mathematical modeling and computational simulation techniques to the study of biological, ecological, behavioral, and social systems.

### What is Genomics?
Genomics is an interdisciplinary field of biology focusing on the structure, function, evolution, mapping, and editing of genomes. A genome is an organism's complete set of DNA, including all of its genes.
